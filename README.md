# Night Lyte

Night Lyte is an interactive web map designed to help pedestrians safeguard their sense of personal safety while navigating New York City streets. Users can utilize the map’s visualization of key datasets – such as open businesses, subway entrances and recent crime incidents – to increase their “visibility” and alter their walking route as desired.
